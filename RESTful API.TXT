A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications that uses 
standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. It follows stateless client-server communication, 
where each request contains all necessary information, and resources are identified by unique URIs. RESTful APIs typically return data 
in JSON or XML format, making them lightweight, scalable, and easy to integrate with various clients (web, mobile, etc.). 
Key principles include uniform interfaces, cacheability, and layered systems, ensuring interoperability and simplicity 
in web services.
